    <string name="description_one">Bro.Bakht Singh (1903 - 2000) was a man of God and a servant of Christ who \"served his own generation by the will of God\" Acts 13:36. He became a Christian while he was a student in Canada. He was India\'s foremost evangelist, preacher and indigenous church planter who founded churches based on New Testament principles. He began a worldwide indigenous church-planting movement in India that eventually saw more than 10,000 local churches. He never sought recognition or status for what he believed the Lord was calling him to do. Br.Bakht Singh went to be with the Lord early September 17, in Hyderabad, India. He was 97.</string>
